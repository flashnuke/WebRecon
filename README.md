### Subdomain Scan (`dns`)

Iterates over a wordlist and probes the target host with each word set as the subdomain.</br>
The results are then contained inside a queue object and used for further scans.

* A host name can be passed with or without a subdomain. This scan performs probes on the target hostname, by replacing the passed subdomain with words from the wordlist
* In order to use a custom wordlist, `"--set-dnsscan-wl"` argument should be passed, followed by the path


### Content Scan (`content`)

Iterates over a wordlist and probes (in a brute manner) different endpoints by appending the words to the target hostname. </br>
A result is considered successful if the request status code returns one of the following: `[200, 301, 302]`


### Bypass403 (`403bypass`)

### NMAP Scan (`nmap`)
