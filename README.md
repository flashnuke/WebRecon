# Requirements
Make sure to set appropriate file permissions: `chmod u+x WebRecon.py`

### Dependencies
Python library dependencies are listed inside `requirements.txt`, and should be installed using `pip3` command. </br>
NMAP should be installed as well.

### OS

Currently only LINUX OS is supported.

# Types of Scans
By default `-sA` (scanAll) argument is true, which means all scanners would run. </br> It is possible to pass a custom list of scans by using the argument `-sC` (scanCustom) followed by a list of scans. The nicknames of the scans are listed in the parenthesis next to each scanner header name below. </br>

An example of a command that would launch all scans, using custom wordlists on target `www.____.com`:

```bash
./WebRecon.py https://www.___.com -sA --set-contentscan-wl /root/PycharmProjects/content_wl.txt2 --set-dnsscan-wl /root/PycharmProjects/dns_wl.txt2
```

* The default wordlists are basic / kali ones. You can pass custom ones using cmdline arguments
* A good source for wordlists: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists

### Subdomain Scan (`dns`)

Iterates over a wordlist and probes the target host with each word set as the subdomain.</br>
The results are then contained inside a queue object and used for further scans.

* A host name can be passed with or without a subdomain. This scan performs probes on the target hostname, by replacing the passed subdomain with words from the wordlist
* In order to use a custom wordlist, `"--set-dnsscan-wl"` argument should be passed, followed by the path


### Content Scan (`content`)

Iterates over a wordlist and probes (in a brute manner) different endpoints by appending the words to the target hostname. </br>
A result is considered successful if the request status code is one of the following: `200`, `301`, `302`. If a forbidden status code is returned (`403`) and `403bypass` scan is enabled, further probing takes place where different kind of methods are attempted in order to bypass the forbidden status. Those attempts are also considered as success only if they manage to retrieve one of the aformentioned successful status code. <br>
</br>
The output in the progress log (and the results file) contains the status code and the page content size.
* In order to use a custom wordlist, "--set-contentscan-wl" argument should be passed, followed by the path
* The default wordlist used here is dirb's `common.txt` list, which is also located under `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/`
* Use the `-e` argument to append custom extensions to each word attempt (i.e -> `-e "php,html"`)

### Bypass403 (`403bypass`)

Probes a url using different methods in order to bypass a `403` forbidden status code. </br> This scan is a subscan and should only be invoked by  `Content Scan`.

* If listing a custom scan list rather than using the `-sA` option, this scan should be listed as well, otherwise it would be disabled
* Most of the methods in this scanner were converted from 2 other known GitHub repos, credit goes to https://github.com/iamj0ker/bypass-403 and https://github.com/yunemse48/403bypasser

### NMAP Scan (`nmap`)

Performs a simple NMAP scan on the host target.

* Custom ports should be passed using the `--set-nmapscan-ports` argument, in the same format they are passed in NMAP,</br> i.e: `"21-25,80,139"`
* Custom commandline arguments for the scan should be passed using the `--set-nmapscan-cmdline_args` argument,</br> i.e: `"-sV -sU -sS"`

# Output
### Results
For each hostname, a directory is created with the hostname as its name. Inside the directory, subdirectories are created with the full name of the subdomain and hostname. (each subdomain has its own subdirectory). </br>
Total results and subdomain scan results are saved in a `.txt` file inside the main hostname directory. <br>
Example of a **subdomain scan** results output text file:</br>

All scans save results inside the subdirectory named as the full hostname + subdomain. </br>
Example: ```results/hostname_com/www_hostname_com/results...txt`

* The default path for results is the current working directory. It can be changed by passing the path following the argument: `--set-results-directory`

### Cache
By default, cache is disabled. Cache files that are older than 30 minutes would be disregarded. </br>
This can be useful for long runs that have the potential of crashing midway.

* It is possible to enable cache by passing the following argument: `-c / --cache`

### Exceptions
No exceptions (other than the ones handled inside the code) are allowed. Any other exception would be logged under `error log` and abort the scan. </br>
